<i>Igneous rocks</i> are formed from molten rocks that have cooled and solidified. Scientists have believed that all rocks on earth were igneous rocks at one point in Earth's history. <br><br>

<h3><b>Igneous Rocks are either:</b></h3>
   <ul>
<li>Crystalline - When they form from cooled magma or lava.
<li>Pyroclastic - When they are made of consolidated eruption products like volcanic ash.
</ul>

<br>1. <b>Crystalline texture</b> differ depending on how fast and where the cooling took place.<br><br>

 A. <i>Intrusive or plutonic rocks</i> that form from slowly cooled magma have time to form large mineral crystals that are visible without the aid of magnifying lens. The resulting texture of this is called phaneritic. They are actually formed below the Earth's surface.<br>
 B. <i>Extrusive or volcanic rocks</i> that form from rapidly cooled magma usually exhibit aphanitic textures. A special volcanic texture is displayed by rocks that cool rapidly that the minerals crystals do not form, usually when lava is expelled underwater. This results in rocks that appear glassy. Another is the vesicular texture which is a result of gases escaping while the volcanic rock is being formed.<br><br>

2. <b>Pyroclastic</b> is the result of the lithification of erupted volcanic material; thus, these types of rocks are distinguished from each other by size of its particle components.<br><br>

<b><h3>There are 3 ways an Igneous rock may form:</h3></b><br>
1. <b>Below the surface from slowly cooling magma</b>- this results in the formation of crystals that are visible to naked eye without the aid of magnifying lens. These types of igneous rocks are called intrusive or plutonic such as granite, diorite, and syenite.<br>
2. <b>On the surface from rapidly cooling lava</b> - this results in the formation of a very small crystals that may not be visible without the use of magnifying lens. These types of igneous rocks are extrusive or volcanic such as basalt, andesite and rhyolite.<br>
3. <b>On the surface from the consolidation of particle erupted by explosive volcanic activity<b> - when volcanoes erupt violently, the lava exiting the volcanoes are ripped apart into smaller pieces by rapidly expanding gases in the lava. Depending on how much gas is present, the particles may solidify as small as ash or as large as basketballs. When these particles come together on the surface  via lithification, they form pyroclastic igneous rocks such as ignimbrite, tuff and volcanic 
breccia.

<h3><b> Common minerals present in Metamorphic rocks </b></h3>
Most igneous rocks are formed from feldspar, quartz, and mica. All of these mineral are classified as silicates because they are made mostly of silicon and oxygen.
